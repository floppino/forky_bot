## What does it do?
    I'm not a bot... traaaash... trash, trash, trash!

### 1st step
Create a file called *token.txt* and copy in it just the token of your bot with no further characters, strings etc.

### 2nd step
From the terminal, while in the directory *Forky*, type as follow:
```sh
$ python main.py
```
Your bot is now alive!

### 3th step
See below for further commands about changing your bot name, description and aboutme info.
