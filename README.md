## What does it do?
    I'm not a bot... trash!

### 1st step
Create a file called *token.txt* and copy in it just the token of your bot with no further characters, strings etc.

### 2nd step
From the terminal, while in the directory of Forky Bot, type *python main.py*, your bot now is alive!

### 3th step
See below for further commands about changing your bot name, description and aboutme info.
